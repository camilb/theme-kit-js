# Contributing to @prezly/theme-kit-nextjs

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

Assuming you have cloned the repo and installed dependencies on your machine, the very next step is to develop the package.

Since theme-kit provides a collection of base functions, hooks, and utilities that work with [Prezly themes](https://github.com/prezly?q=theme-nextjs&type=all&language=&sort=) under the hood, in order to make changes and test things out on your side, you're gonna need to keep a theme running in parallel with the theme-kit.

So if you haven't already, go ahead and follow the [instructions on Bea theme](https://github.com/prezly/theme-nextjs-bea#quick-start) to get it up and running.

As you can already see in the theme's `package.json` file, we're using `@prezly/theme-kit-nextjs` package. So we need to make sure that our theme is using our local version of theme-kit and not the one's in the theme's `node_modules` folder. How do we achieve that?

There's this awesome package called [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc), which serves the purpose for our use case! So let's install it:

```
npm i yalc -g
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```
yarn global add yalc
```

The `yalc` package maintains its own local "store", at `~/.yalc`. Publish a package with yalc, and a full copy of the package is copied to the store. Install a package from the yalc store, and the project will install that copy much like it would install a package from an external registry. Update a package published to the yalc store, and the update is now available in the dependent projects; you can even publish and automatically update dependent projects with a single command.

Go back to **theme-kit's project root** folder and run:

```
yalc publish
```

This will publish the package in the yalc's local store, then go back to your **theme's project root**, and run the following commands:

```bash
npm uninstall -S @prezly/theme-kit-nextjs
yalc add @prezly/theme-kit-nextjs
npm install
```

What did we do? We simply removed the theme's `@prezly/theme-kit-nextjs` package in `node_modules` and told our theme to use the local version of the package on our file system!

Now the fun part begins, go ahead and hack the package (Make changes) :) Once you're done, simply run the following in **theme-kit's project root** folder:

```bash
yalc push
```

It acts like you have released a new version of your package that your theme can use.
And don't forget to run `npm install` in the theme's folder _if you have changed dependencies_ for the **theme-kit**.

If the changes are not automatically picked up by theme's dev server, restart the **theme's dev server**.
